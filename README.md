# nulls
nullifies A and D keypresses

so basically when you hold A and D in counter-strike, it stops you from moving.

this script stops that from happening (hence, NULLifying your A and D keypresses so both don't trigger at the same time)

on linux, put the file in your home folder like this

and type this into your terminal:
sudo python3 nullse.py

it should look something like this (but your keyboard names will be different to mine).
(please note that you need the python3-evdev package)

on windows, install python and just double click the file.
OR use the autohotkey script here: https://gist.github.com/777777771/eff2044a94d99e6aa3302f8dbafbaad7
