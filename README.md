# nulls
nullifies A and D keypresses

so basically when you hold A and D in counter-strike, it stops you from moving.

this script stops that from happening (hence, NULLifying your A and D keypresses so both don't trigger at the same time)

on linux, put the file in your home folder like this

and type this into your terminal:
sudo python3 nullse.py

it should look something like this (but your keyboard names will be different to mine).

on windows, install python and just double click the file.
